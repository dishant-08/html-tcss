## Why Tailwind CSS?

You might have noticed that this resume is visually compelling and responsive. That's thanks to Tailwind CSS! I chose Tailwind CSS for this project because of its simplicity and flexibility. With Tailwind CSS, I can quickly style elements without writing custom CSS from scratch. It allows for rapid development, making the design process efficient and hassle-free. Tailwind CSS is a great choice for creating modern, responsive web pages without the need for complex CSS rules.
